## Deployment
Algorithms in Action is written in JavaScript, using the React framework. To make it work locally, you need to install Node.js. NPM (Node package manager) will be installed alongside when you install Node.js. We use express framework to implement our back-end

Ensure you have node version 14.x and npm version 6.x
To check your version, type
node --version 
npm --version

Navigate into front and back folder seperately and run npm install to install all independecies in package.json

Running on local 
Navigate into front and back folder separtely and run npm start, it will start both front and back-end side of web
Front-end side of client will run in port 3000, and will be launched at browser http://
localhost:3000
Front-end side of admin  will run in port 3001, and will be launched at browser http://localhost:3001
